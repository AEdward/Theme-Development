OceanWP Child Theme by Anahom
=================

Am using Child Theme for the  WordPress theme Development project.

### Usage
Simply download the zip and upload the zip (oceanwp-child-theme-by-Anahom.zip) under your WordPress dashboard at Appearance > Themes. Or extract and upload via FTP at wp-content/themes/.


### Renaming
You can of course rename the zip file so it isn't called oceanwp-child-theme-by-Anahom.zip (you should do this so it makes more sense) and you can also change the "Theme Name" at the top of the style.css file.
